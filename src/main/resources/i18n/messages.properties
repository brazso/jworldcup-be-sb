<p>Registered users can play with each other with this exciting soccer betting game. A bet to be staked is simple, the exact result of the match must be entered before its starting time. Each game belongs to an international football tournament, for example a world cup. A tournament consists of matches and those results must be tipped. Each user may select an favourite teams for the group stage and another one for the knockout stage. Player gets double score if her bet wins on a match where her favourite team is involved. The results of the players can be checked during the tournament, after the event a certificate of merit can be printed to prove the player's result. Any user can create an user group where her buddies can be added to. The results also can be viewed of these user groups, so smaller companies can be played isolated from the others. There is a top players list where the best performances of all tournaments are displayed globally. Based on an balanced calculation, the player's results of all finished events are sorted and the best ones are shown here.</p>\
<p><strong>How a bet on a match is evaluated</strong></p>\
<p>After a match is over, its result is compared to the player's bet, and the following score is added to the player's sum. Only the first matching rule takes into account.</p>\
<ul>\
<li>exact result (e.g. match is 1:0, bet is also 1:0): <strong>3 points</strong></li>\
<li>exact (signed) goal difference (e.g. match is 1:0, bet is 2:1): <strong>2 points</strong></li>\
<li>approximately result (e.g. match is 1:0, bet is 2:0): <strong>1 points</strong></li>\
</ul>\
<p>The order of the teams are important. No points are gained if in your bet, except the draw bet, the participant teams are in reversed order. A draw bet may gain 0, 2 or 3 points but never 1 point, because the goal difference is always constant 0 value at draws.</p>\
<ul>\
<li>favorite team is participant: <strong>double multiplier</strong> on the gained points</li>\
</ul>\
<p>If a favorite team is one of the participants of the match, double score is gained. In this case a player can get 0, 2, 4 or 6 points after a bet. Favourite team might be selected for the group stage, any team of the tournament can be choosen, but it must be done before the starting time of the first match. When the group stage is over, a new favourite team should be selected for the knockout stage.&nbsp; It can be done before the starting time of the first match of the knockout stage. Bear in mind, that knockout favourite team also should be chosen if the group favourite team gets into the knockout stage. Ther latter one is not placed automatically to the knockout favourite team.</p>\
<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\
<ul>\
<li>email is sent only from the application when a function is initiated by the user where email confirmation is needed</li>\
<li>if you never want to change your email address and/or passwords later, you may use easily temporarily created email address given by 3rd parties</li>\
<li>mobile application client development is in progress. For the time being the game can be played only in browsers.</li>\
